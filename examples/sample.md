### Course Description and Learning Outcomes

This is a course on applications of discrete math, algebra and number theory concepts to problems in computing.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Understand basic concepts in algebra and number theory: properties of integers (e.g. divisibility, equivalence modulo m).
* Understand basic concepts in graph theory: coloring.
* Understand basic concepts in asymptotics.
* Understand applications of discrete math, algebra and number theory concepts to problems in computing.
* Develop an understanding of how to read and construct valid mathematical statements, arguments (proofs) and understand mathematical statements (theorems).

### Course Staff

The class has two Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) who will be responsible for teaching the labs, holding office hours, and can assist with grading. There are also three Learning Assistants (LAs) who can help (but not lead) labs and hold office hours.

### Textbook and Resources

The textbooks for this course are:

  * **Optional:** [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp/dp/0495391328) by Susanna S. Epp, Cengage Learning; 4th edition (August 4, 2010)

You can get the e-book or may want to check Amazon.com for a cheaper copy.

### Grading

**Approximate grading:**
   * 5%: Participation (Lectures, Labs, Office Hours, Piazza)
   * 15%: Midterm #1
   * 15%: Midterm #2
   * 30%: Final
   * 35%: Homework 

### Course Policies

> **If you have a disability that may affect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic accommodations, please contact us as soon as possible.**

**Late work policy:**
  * TBD

**Email policy:** You can send emails to both professors. We will answer most class emails during specific times set aside during the week for this purpose - so do not expect an instantaneous response. 

**Illness policy:** If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance if possible. I cannot extend deadlines unless you provide a note from a doctor. Otherwise, use a late pass.

**Academic Integrity policy:** It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

You must:
  * Do your best to solve all homework, and exams on your own.
  * Write the name of any student you collaborated with on your homework as a comment at the top of your main file (subject to the constraints below).

You may:
  * Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with up to 1 other student in the class.

You may not:
  * Copy homework from other students or people outside of the class.
  * Have someone else do the homework for you.
  * Copy answers or lemmas or proofs from the internet unless they are specifically provided by the instructors as being apart of the course material.
  * Write up the answers to the homework as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you are working together with someone to solve a problem, each of you should be writing up your own independent solution.

The [Academic Integrity Code](https://github.com/GWU-CSCI3411-Fall16/hw-0-gparmer/blob/master/cs_integrity.md) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. **Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course**, and are elaborated in the [GW Academic Integrity Code](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity). Note that the _minimum_ punishment is failure of the assignment.
